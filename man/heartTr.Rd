Heart Transplant Data
}
\description{
The Stanford University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine whether an experimental heart transplant program increased lifespan. Each patient entering the program was designated officially a heart transplant candidate, meaning that he was gravely ill and would most likely benefit from a new heart. Then the actual heart transplant occurs between a few weeks to several months depending on the availability of a donor. Very few candidates during this waiting period show improvement and get \emph{deselected} as a heart transplant candidate, but for the purposes of this experiment those patients were kept in the data as continuing candidates.

\usage{data(heartTr)}
\format{
  A data frame with 103 observations on the following 8 variables.

    \item{\code{id}}{ID number of the patient.}
    \item{\code{acceptyear}}{Year of acceptance as a heart transplant candidate.}
    \item{\code{age}}{Age of the patient at the beginning of the study.}
    \item{\code{survived}}{Survival status with levels \code{alive} and \code{dead}.}
    \item{\code{survtime}}{Number of days patients were alive after the date they were determined to be a candidate for a heart transplant until the termination date of the study}
    \item{\code{prior}}{Whether or not the patient had prior surgery with levels \code{yes} and \code{no}.}
    \item{\code{transplant}}{Transplant status with levels \code{control} (did not receive a transplant) and \code{treatment} (received a transplant).}
